  "readme": "# <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpack/media/master/logo/icon-square-small.png\" height=\"40\" align=\"right\" /> [Plug'n'Play](https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs/pull/101) resolver for Webpack\n\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pnp-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnp-webpack-plugin)\n[![node version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/pnp-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnp-webpack-plugin)\n\n*This plugin is also available for Jest ([jest-pnp-resolver](https://github.com/arcanis/jest-pnp-resolver)), Rollup ([rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve](https://github.com/arcanis/rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve)), and TypeScript ([ts-pnp](https://github.com/arcanis/ts-pnp))*\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nyarn add -D pnp-webpack-plugin\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply add the plugin to both the `resolver` and `resolveLoader`:\n\n```js\nconst PnpWebpackPlugin = require(`pnp-webpack-plugin`);\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  resolve: {\n    plugins: [\n      PnpWebpackPlugin,\n    ],\n  },\n  resolveLoader: {\n    plugins: [\n      PnpWebpackPlugin.moduleLoader(module),\n    ],\n  },\n};\n```\n\nThe `resolve` entry will take care of correctly resolving the dependencies required by your program, and the `resolveLoader` entry will help Webpack find the location of the loaders on the disk. Note that in this case, all loaders will be resolved relative to the package containing your configuration.\n\nIn case part of your configuration comes from third-party packages that use their own loaders, make sure they use `require.resolve` - this will ensure that the resolution process is portable accross environments (including when Plug'n'Play isn't enabled), and prevent it from relying on undefined behaviors:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [{\n      test: /\\.js$/,\n      loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),\n    }]\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### `ts-loader` integration\n\nThis plugin as an integration to easily add support for TypeScript in your applications through `ts-loader`. In order to do this, just do the following:\n\n```js\nconst PnpWebpackPlugin = require(`pnp-webpack-plugin`);\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [{\n      test: /\\.ts$/,\n      loader: require.resolve('ts-loader'),\n      options: PnpWebpackPlugin.tsLoaderOptions({\n        // ... regular options go there ...\n      }),\n    }],\n  },\n};\n```\n\nIf you have any options you want to pass to `ts-loader`, just pass them as parameter of the `tsLoaderOptions` function and it will take care of forwarding them properly.\n\n## `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` integration\n\nWe also provide an integration for `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`, in a similar way to what we do with `ts-loader`. Here's an example:\n\n```js\nconst ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin = require(`fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`);\nconst PnpWebpackPlugin = require(`pnp-webpack-plugin`);\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    new ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin(PnpWebpackPlugin.forkTsCheckerOptions({\n      // ... regular options go there ...\n    }),\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n## License (MIT)\n\n> **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison**\n>\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n>\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n>\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
