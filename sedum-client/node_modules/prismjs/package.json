  "readme": "# [Prism](http://prismjs.com/)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PrismJS/prism.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PrismJS/prism)\n[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/prismjs.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prismjs)\n\nPrism is a lightweight, robust, elegant syntax highlighting library. It's a spin-off project from [Dabblet](http://dabblet.com/).\n\nYou can learn more on [prismjs.com](https://prismjs.com/).\n\n[Why another syntax highlighter?](https://lea.verou.me/2012/07/introducing-prism-an-awesome-new-syntax-highlighter/#more-1841)\n\n[More themes for Prism!](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes)\n\n## Contribute to Prism!\n\nPrism depends on community contributions to expand and cover a wider array of use cases. If you like it, considering giving back by sending a pull request. Here are a few tips:\n\n- Read the [documentation](https://prismjs.com/extending.html). Prism was designed to be extensible.\n- Do not edit `prism.js`, it’s just the version of Prism used by the Prism website and is built automatically. Limit your changes to the unminified files in the `components/` folder. The minified files are also generated automatically.\n- The build system uses [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to minify the files and build `prism.js`. Having gulp installed, you just need to run the command `gulp`.\n- Please follow the code conventions used in the files already. For example, I use [tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment](http://lea.verou.me/2012/01/why-tabs-are-clearly-superior/). Opening braces are on the same line, closing braces on their own line regardless of construct. There is a space before the opening brace. etc etc.\n- Please try to err towards more smaller PRs rather than few huge PRs. If a PR includes changes I want to merge and changes I don't, handling it becomes difficult.\n- My time is very limited these days, so it might take a long time to review longer PRs (short ones are usually merged very quickly), especially those modifying the Prism Core. This doesn't mean your PR is rejected.\n- If you contribute a new language definition, you will be responsible for handling bug reports about that language definition.\n- If you add a new language definition, theme or plugin, you need to add it to `components.json` as well and rebuild Prism by running `gulp`, so that it becomes available to the download build page. For new languages, please also add a few [tests](https://prismjs.com/test-suite.html) and an example in the `examples/` folder.\n\nThank you so much for contributing!!\n\n## Translations\n\n* [![中文说明](http://awesomes.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/readme.png)](http://www.awesomes.cn/repo/PrismJS/prism)\n",
